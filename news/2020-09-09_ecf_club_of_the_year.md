# Awarded ECF 'Club of the Year'

We are proud to announce that we have been recognised for the English Chess Federation award ‘Club of the Year’.  

The last year has been one of the most successful in living memory for the club as we have sought to establish new avenues to play chess while also improving upon established ones. Membership has risen dramatically, and this has enabled us to become a significant force on the competitive chess scene. We have become national (BUCA) champions, winning several inter-universities matches and having all three teams finish first in their respective regional leagues.  
  
On the social side, we’ve been able to run weekly club nights and regularly pub chess nights. College chess has seen a resurgence with the resurrection of the inter-College Cuppers league and tournament. Simuls with GMs Keith Arkell and Hou Yifan have been particular highlights of the year as well. We have also seen an unprecedented increase in Outreach programmes and the creation of weekly teaching sessions, establishing our place in the community and as the centre of Chess in Oxford.  

We’d like to thank the current and previous committees for all their hard work and the members for making this success possible. We couldn’t run all these events if you were not willing to come and play chess so thank you. We’re hoping build on the success of this year and we’ve got a lot of exciting events planned and so keep an eye on this page.
