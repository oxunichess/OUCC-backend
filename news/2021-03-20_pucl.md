Congratulations to our Pro Uni Chess League Team, who narrowly lost in the national final today against Southampton Uni on tiebreak. After making it all the way from the group stages, which started back in October, they beat LSE and Cambridge in the knockout stages to make today's final. Despite being 7-5 down going into the last round of games against an extremely strong Southampton team, they mounted a stunning comeback to tie the match 8-8, before losing a nail-biting tiebreak round. Thanks to everyone who played in the competition this year: Max French, Chris Finn, Thomas Moss, Akshaya Kalaiyalahan, Karthik Saravanan, Victor Altherr, and a particular shout-out to Filip Mihov, who came second in the tournament's MVP leaderboard.
