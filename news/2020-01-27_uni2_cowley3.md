# Comfortable win from Uni2 against Cowley3

### Monday 27th January - by Kevin Henbest

Thanks to everyone who played today a real team effort to win 4:2. Wins for Dan, Tudor, John, and Shree on the top four boards beating some good players. Dan converted a very nice rook and pawn versus rook ending with some nice skills. Tudor's game was slow burner and last to finish but he also won a rook and pawn ending with considerably more pawns on the board forking his opponents remaining pawns. John won a nice game when his opponent allowed him two connected passed pawns in the center and they steamrollered down the board, a nice conversion. Shree exchanged into a two minor piece ending and then proceeded to outplay Maria and picked up her pawns with a fork with his knight. Fernando had a tougher time dropping a pawn and having to give up the exchange to complicate but his opponent consolidated and GabrielÄ— got caught in a nasty pin and had to give up material  but played actively and got some compensation and created threats, and played a competitive game so lots to be positive about in her game, all good experience.
