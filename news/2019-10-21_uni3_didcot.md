## A house out of order

### The third team takes an early loss against Didcot
### 21st October 2019 - by Boris Gusev

The third team lost 1.5-4.5, but given how close some of the games were, a rematch should be a strong challenge.

Our board 1, Ben Greenbury, had Alekhine’s defence with a very early queen trade resulting in a draw.

Board 2, our Vice President, had a nail biter with 3 passes connected pawns vs a bishop, but with very little time left. A small crowd formed watching moves being blitzed out in a tense game. Unfortunately, we finally ended up flagging.

Gregor Aubrey on board 3 had a nice positional advantage with two strong knights in a closed position. However a QR battery looked too intimidating, and a wrong step with a pawn in front of the king blocking the only escape square for the knight left us a piece down.

Board 4, our captain, Boris, ended with a rushed miscalculation and what should have been a pawn advantage turned into being a rook down.

Board 5 saw the debut of Fernando Almansa, a Fresher, who secured a nice advantage being a couple pawns up in mid game left his opponent spending a lot of time hoping for some counter play. None was found and a win was secured.

We unfortunately had a default on board 6, emphasising the opportunities and importance for Freshers and any potential players to get involved and respond to posts if you want to play. Onwards and upwards for the rest of term!
