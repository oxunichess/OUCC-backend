## Uni2 snubbed by Bicester1

### Tuesday 25th February - by Kevin Henbest

Thanks to everyone who played tonight especially Dan, who rushed back from his conference to play and made his own way to the venue.

We had a tough evening, Dan put up a good fight but finally lost a rook and pawn ending, Jack sacrificed a pawn and ended up not getting a much compensation and ended up facing two passed pawns that decided  the issue. Tudor continued his good form and won a good game  but  Andrei and myself could only draw, myself being lucky to draw a pawn down. Suleyman Selim put up a great fight right to the last  few minutes but the material imbalance eventually made itself apparent. So we got beat 4:2. We were unlucky because Dan was better at one point we could easily have drawn the match, It was a cold dark night so much appreciation to everyone who supported Uni2 tonight. Despite this I think everyone enjoyed their games. Full result below.
