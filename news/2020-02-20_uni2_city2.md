## Uni2 upset win against City2

### Thursday 20th February - by Kevin Henbest

Many thanks to everyone who played tonight despite being significantly out graded we won a storming match versus City 2 tonight. 5:1. Excellent games all of them. Good swindle from Tom, who showed his experience against a younger player.  Shree mated his opponent in the middle of the board. Tudor played really well right up to the end, beating a 177, who is a very experienced player. John had a very quick win in a complex Queen Rook and pawn endgame, and Callum keeps on winning, another excellent game. Jack was always going to find it tough on board 1 versus 193, however it was an enterprising game with lots of tactics.
