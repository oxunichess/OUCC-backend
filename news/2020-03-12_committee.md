Many thanks to our last year's committee, for what has been one of the most successful years in the history of Oxford University Chess Club ever. It's quite unnecessary to show it in terms of mere appreciation, the record itself demonstrates it. This year we became British Universities' Chess Association champions (for the first time in 9 years) with a perfect score, qualified to represent #TeamGB at EUSA Chess, won the ODCL's first division, finished first in a 2020 Chess Qualifiers round, restarted and won the historic Valentines Cup match with Imperial College London, launched a successful new University of Oxford Cuppers League with 11 teams taking part, reached out to 3 of our nearby friendly universities and organised matches against them, invited GM WGM Yifan Hou and GM Keith Arkell for simultaneous exhibition events, and have secured funding ensuring the club's continued welfare with our new partners Jane Street Recruiting and Chess and Bridge Shop. We also donated over £150 to Oxfam, through our collaboration with 2020 chess, including donating our £100 prize money from its regional qualifiers. It's only gonna get better from here folks.
