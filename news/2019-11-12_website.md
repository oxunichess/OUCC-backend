## New website release

### 12th November 2018 - by Aloysius Lip

The website has undergone a rewrite to a technology called [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/). To the casual user, you might see a few new cool features (like our news bar and our [Termcard](/termcard)). The main change from our side however is that we can *update* and *post* a lot more frequently! It's a lot easier to change things. Add the site as a bookmark and check back frequently to see the latest updates.
