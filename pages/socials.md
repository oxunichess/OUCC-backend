## Bi-Termly Pub Chess

At the beginning and end of every term, the Oxford University Chess Club invites all its members and anyone interesting in joining to a casual, chess-playing event where we take-over the Kings' Arms. Pints and bets galore!

A fun opportunity to meet the chess community and get involved without any expectations or competitiveness.
