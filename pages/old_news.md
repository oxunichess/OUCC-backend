## New Season Underway!

### Sun, 20 Oct 2013 14:20:00 -0700

We really enjoyed meeting you all at freshers' fair and drinks!

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ydWq3u8nAJA/UmRFqt64KGI/AAAAAAAAACM/f5dVz681tKY/s320/chess_fair.jpg)

There's a whole host of exciting chess on offer this term. Things are kicking off from Wednesday, when we're starting our freshers' blitz tournament at Christ Church at 7:30pm. At 5 minutes a game, blitz chess is a refreshing way to add an element of frantic scrabbling to a game that's typically thought of for its sophistication.

Why not download our [termcard](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chess/termcard) so you can keep up with everything going on? In particular, write down our freshers' varsity in your diary and join us in showing the other place why we're the best university!

Finally, our second team begins their season tomorrow away at Witney. New players are always welcome to get involved in competitive chess, so please feel free to read about our [teams](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chess/leagues).

See you around!

## OUCC 1s Finish 4th in ODCL Div 1

### Sat, 04 May 2013 15:00:00 -0700

After charging through to a brilliant start at the beginning of the season, Uni 1 had sights aimed high. Taking the scalps of the county's top teams like Witney and Cowley was a definite highlight. But as fatigue started to set in, our strained team struggled to stay in form. We ended with a respectable 4th place in the middle of the league, in line with the results of the past few years. As Uni players come and go ever so frequently, we were very fortunate to have such a strong batch of new players this year. It was a season well fought, let's hope for the best next year!

## OUCC 2s to Remain in ODCL Div 3

### Tue, 30 Apr 2013 18:00:00 -0700

## Report by Erik Thörnblad

After a tough season Uni II finally showed what they are worth by beating City III with 5-1, thus avoiding relegation! Captain Noam's game was the first to finish. His opponent missed that his knight was attacked by a pawn, and after that it was easy task cleaning up. Ben won a piece in an effective way by forcing his opponent to shut in his own bishop which could then be attacked by a pawn. Meanwhile, Matthew played a heavy piece endgame with a pawn up, and traded down to a winning pawn endgame that he handled well. At that point the top three boards were still playing, with myself being a pawn up after an extremely early d5 in the Spanish from my opponent, and later a whole rook up since my opponent's king was stuck in the centre and the tactics couldn't be stopped. I later blundered a bishop back (doh!), but the endgame was still easily winning with an outside passer. Sean outplayed his opponent in a Grand Prix Attack and won the ensuing endgame easily. The craziest game of the day was board 2, where Hendrik as black had an extremely sharp King's Indian. I'm not too sure what happened, for every time I went over it looked completely different. Well played everyone, and thanks for this season!

## Varsity Matches 2013 Report

### Sat, 16 Mar 2013 15:12:00 -0700

## By David Hewitt

On the 3rd March we set off to Cambridge for 2nds Varsity, feeling hopeful that we could continue from the success of Freshers' Varsity and possibly win the full trio of 1st, 2nd and freshers' varsity.  

A couple of hours later on the nauseating X5 bus route and our resolve was wavering. Despite rallying over lunch we fell behind slightly when the games began, making us fight to recover the match. Strong play by David Lawrence, Hendrik Brackmann and Ben Sloman scored us the points we needed to reach one game to go at 4-4 apiece to Oxford and Cambridge. Our much-loved Erik Thornblad ended up playing the last game to a time scramble finish, and unfortunately he had no better option than to draw. The match was thus drawn overall at 4.5-4.5, and while it wasn't the win we'd hoped for, it'll do.  

Next week on the 9th March we headed to the Royal Automobile Club for the Varsity Match 2013\. We outgraded Cambridge on the top four boards and were ourselves outgraded on the lower four. We won the toss, but with the first win going Cambridge's way and a draw as the second result, things again began to look patchy.  

The match closed off in just over four hours, with our players valiantly clawing our way back to a narrow 3.5-4.5 defeat.  

The best game was awarded to Raja Panjwani for his win over Sam Franklin, and the brilliancy to Howard Chiu for his winning game against Adam Scibior. Many thanks to all the members of the RAC, especially Henry Mutkin, who make this event possible every year.

## St. Hugh's Win Cuppers 2010

### Sat, 27 Feb 2010 08:00:00 -0800

After the success of last year's event, we staged another Chess Cuppers tournament on Sunday 21<sup>st</sup> February. After the withdrawal of a couple of teams and the amalgamation of some others who did not have the necessary four players, the tournament consisted of six teams: Worcester/Trinity, St. John’s, St. Hugh’s, Lincoln, St. Catz and Trinity.  

The initial round-robin league phase was keenly contested, and after three of the five rounds it looked as if any of the teams could make the final, with four of them tied on 7 game points out of 12, one on 5 and the other on 3.  

Worcester/Trinity’s 4-0 fourth-round win over Trinity put them in the driving seat with 11 points going into the final round, while a hard fought draw between Lincoln and St. Catz coupled with a 3.5-0.5 win by St. Hugh’s over St. John’s ensured that there would be a major battle for that all-important second spot in the final. A draw between Lincoln and St. John’s blew their hopes, leaving it down to St. Catz and St. Hugh’s. St. Catz put in a huge performance to beat Worcester/Trinity 2.5-1.5, however it was not enough as St. Hugh’s continued their great form to beat Trinity 4-0 and secure the second final berth.  

Victory in the third-place playoff went to St. Catz over Lincoln, leaving the stage set for a battle between the top two. For a long time, it looked to be very close, however, St. Hugh’s form eventually showed as they began to exert pressure on all boards. The Worcester/Trinity players defended bravely, but ultimately were unable to hold out. So St. Hugh’s, incredibly, won the final 4-0, meaning that in their final three matches they dropped only a single half game point!  

Congratulations to them!  

Special mentions should also go to the players on each board who scored the most points in the league phase. These were:  

*   Board 1 -– Alaric Stephen, St. Catz (4/5),
*   Board 2 – Denis Menschkau, St. John’s (4.5/5),
*   Board 3 – Sam Evington, Worcester/Trinity and Will Faulks, Lincoln (4/5),
*   Board 4 – Jay Unadkat, St. Hugh’s and Jack Binysh, Lincoln (4/5) .

## Oxford University Rapidplay 2009

### Sun, 15 Nov 2009 08:00:00 -0800

On Saturday 7th November we ran our 7th Annual Oxford University Rapidplay tournament at Lincoln College. The event ran extremely smoothly and attracted numerous entrants from all around the country. The total entry was 68, up by 20 from last year. Many thanks to everyone who helped to make this such a success!  

The U170 section proved to be very close, with the prize winners not being decided until the last few minutes of the final round. Indeed, for a while it looked possible that we might end up with a four-way tie for first place! However, Graham Alcock (Didcot) managed to pull through in his game against Ti Chen (Oxford University) to cap a magnificent 6/6 performance and take the victory. Ed Farrington (Oxford University) and Gary Jackson (Banbury) also managed to win tight games in the final round to secure joint second place between them. An impressive four straight wins to finish gave Tom Rixon (Hemel Hempstead) the U145 grading prize. Full results from this section are available [here](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~chess/resources/rapidplay2009/U170Crosstable.pdf).  

The Open was just as interesting, with numerous talented juniors competing with some established names. In the end, the top seed, GM Alexander Cherniaev (Hackney) conceded just two draws, to Thanasis Tsanas (Oxford University) and James Holland (Maidenhead), on his way to claiming first place. The decisive result turned out to be Cherniaev’s impressive win against one of England’s most promising juniors, Brandon Clarke (Littlethorpe), in the penultimate round. Second place was shared by Holland, who was awarded the U190 grading prize, Tsanas and Clarke.

## Keble Wins Chess Cuppers 2009

### Fri, 20 Feb 2009 08:00:00 -0800

### Report by Eoin Devane

Sunday saw the much-anticipated return of Cuppers to the Chess calendar, in the form of an eight-team, four-board, 15 minute tournament held at Keble.  
The eight college teams (Keble, Exeter, Blackfriars, Univ, Merton x 2, St. Catz x 2) were divided into two groups of four for a round-robin group stage, which would be followed by semi-finals and a final.  

In group A, a three-way battle between the strong teams from Exeter, Univ and Merton for the two qualifying berths ensued. Merton’s lower-board strength resulted in draws with both Exeter and Univ. The decisive result proved to be Univ’s surprise 3 – 1 win over Exeter, sending them through top of the group ahead of Merton.  

Group B was dominated by pre-tournament favourites Keble, who scored an impressive 11 / 12 to set up a semi-final against Merton. Second place went to Blackfriars, who defeated both St. Catz B and Merton Magic.  

Both semi-finals were very closely contested, with many of the games going the distance. The big surprise package of the tournament, Blackfriars, came extremely close to beating Univ, winning on two of the boards and losing tightly fought games on the top two to go down on the tie-break rule. In the other semi final, Merton knew they would have to perform exceptionally to have any chance against the all-conquering Keble. It looked as if a shock might be on the cards when Merton won on board 4, but Keble’s top three players showed their class though by grinding down their opponents in tough games to ensure that Keble would face Univ in the final.  

First, however, third place had to be decided. Blackfriars drew first blood when board 1 Patrick Mitchell checkmated Merton’s George Raptis with a nice combination. Nevertheless, it looked as if Merton would clinch third, with the other three games going their way. Soon, Ben Waugh levelled the score with a fine win for Merton, while Eoin Devane forced a won endgame on board 2\. The match would thus come down to board 3, where Alex Antao had a winning position but was desperately low on time. This told, and David Baird capitalised on a mistake by Antao to seal the victory for Blackfriars on the tie-break rule.  
Having dropped only two points in the entire tournament thus far, Keble were clear favourites to win the final against Univ. Indeed Ting Xu soon gave them the advantage with a win over Bernard Reed on board 4\. However, while Jonny Perrin’s impressive play against Ed Hardy on 2 looked set to give Keble a 2 – 0 lead, things were far from over. Ben Kirollos was looking dominant against Keble’s Agnese Salputra on 3 and the mercurial Mike Healey looked to have the stronger position against Tom Eckersley-Waites on 1\. If both boards went against Keble, Univ would win on tiebreak. Once again, time proved significant; Kirollos’ flag fell, giving Keble the victory. There was still time, however, for a grandstand finish in the form of a time scramble between Healey and Eckersley-Waites which ended in Healey capturing his opponent’s king with both players having fewer than 2 seconds remaining!  

Thus, Keble won the first Chess Cuppers of this Century. I dare say, given the success of the event, that it will not be the last.  

Final standings:  

1.  Keble
2.  Univ
3.  Blackfriars
4.  Merton
5.  Exeter
6.  Merton Magic (Merton B)
7.  St. Catz B
8.  St. Catz A
