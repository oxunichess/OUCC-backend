## Simultaneous Exhibitions

In the Trinity Term of 2019, we hosted a Simultaneous Exhibition against GM Hou Yifan, the current Women's World Number 1 chess player. Yifan is the youngest ever to win the Women's World Chess Championship (16), which she achieved 4 times, in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2016, and the youngest ever to achieve the title of Women's Grandmaster and FIDE-rated 2659. Yifan is a Rhodes Scholar, and at the time was reading an MSc in Education at St Hilda's College for the 2018-2019 academic year.

In the Hilary Term of 2019, we hosted WGM IM Irina Bulmaga for a Simultaneous Exhibition of 20 boards. The result were 18 wins to Irina, 1 draw, and 1 win to second team member Tudor Enescu.

In the Hilary Term of 2020, we hosted GM Keith Arkell for a Simultaneous Exhibition of 23 boards. The result were 20.5 wins to Keith, 3 draws, 1 win to Richard Zhu, St Hild'as College. See our [photo album](https://www.facebook.com/oxfordunichess/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2610864912468131).

The club also has a long history of running simultaneous exhibition. In 2013, we hosted GM Darmen Sadvakasov, ex-Junior World Champion. At the Second Annual Varsity Match against Cambridge, Johannes Zukertort ("the greatest player never to be World Champion") gave a six-board match blindfold whilst waiting for the final six games to finish; Joseph Henry Blackburne ("The Black Death") see [this report](../files/Second_Annual_Varsity.pdf) from the [City of London chess magazine](../files/The_City_of_London_chess_magaziney.pdf).
